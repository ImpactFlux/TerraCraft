Welcome to TerraCraft.  

   ImpactFlux Here!
      Ever decide you hate the biome that you are in after you built your entire base?  Don't you hate how the ores that you have mined don't regenerate?
   Never fear TerraCraft is here!
   
   But seriously, this mod is designed in mind to replace the biome that you are with the corresponding blocks that match the newly chosen biome.  This mod is designed
   using the CoFHLib and the design and implementation is inspired by KingLemming and ThermalExpansion.  The goal of this mod is to give the players a properly balanced,
   grief proof way to alter the biomes that they have created.  Additionally, my goal is to provide unique tools to the players that aren't based on power gen or ore processing.
   
   Currently I am in an extremely alpha state, however I have already created the algorithm that replaces the biome.  The next month or so will be flushing out the mod to include
   all the tools, blocks, textures and gui's to make this a first class mod.  Once the first build goes Alpha.  I will be closing the source of the mod.  However I am in need of 
   textures (I'm a software developer, not a graphic artist) and I will gladly provide personal support and beta builds to those who contribute.  
   
   Furthermore, I will be creating a 1.7.2 server that people are welcome to come and play one once I get an Alpha version of the mod up.  Now to the good stuff

Current Features:

	- Two new ores:
		- Ecopoiesis - this ore provides the structure for regenerating the terrain.  Even the word itself means "house building" and will provide the 
					   stone, dirt and sand necessary to terraform the world of Minecraft.
		- Genesis - this ore provides the goodies, or the upper tier of terraforming.  This ore has base properties of every registered ore in the dictionary
					and provide chances of replacing parts of the structure with these new properties.
		
	- New tools
		- Each ore has the whole complement of tools that can be made out of them.  
		
	- New Fluids
		- Each ore can be turned into a fluid which will be consumed by the biome changing blocks.  
		
	- Basic Biome Changing Block
		- The algorithm that changes the biomes has been developed and inserted into this recipeless block.  This block in its current form will be removed later and replaced with
		  a single block that requires power, eco fluid to simply replace the biome into a random choice of four biome types.
		  
	- Config Customizing
		- Each feature/block/effect will be customizable via the server config.  THis is to allow server operators the ability to tweak and alter this mod to their needs.

For sure features:
	- Advanced Biome Changing Block
		- This will the middle tier of the biome changing block.  This will be a multiblock structure that takes in power and eco fluid to regenerate biomes.  Custom
		  renderings and guis will be provided to the user to select the biome types that it can be terraformed into.
		  
	- Extreme Biome Changing Block 
		- This is essentially the same as the block above, however it will intake Genesis fluid to allow the user to regenerate the ore nodes in each chunk/biome.  The one caveat
		  is that for each time this block is ran, the number of nodes for each ore type will have a chance to decrease by one.  Essentially giving diminishing returns.

	- Tool Effects
		- Each tool of each ore type will have special effects that will be implemented to provide significant incentive for the player to use the tools.
		
	- Fluid Effects:
		- Each fluid will have effects that will alter the landscape in some terraforming way.
		
	- Terraforming Effects:
		- While terraforming is in progress certain effects (sky color/lightning) will be present to the user as well.
